This is a simple Brick Breaker game implemented in Python using the Pygame library. The objective of the game is to destroy all the bricks using a ball that bounces around the screen, controlled by a paddle at the bottom. The game becomes progressively more challenging as you advance through the levels.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Brick Breaker game, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

   pip install pygame
   ```

### How to Play
